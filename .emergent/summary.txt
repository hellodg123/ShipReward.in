**original_problem_statement**:
The user's goal is a complete, iterative overhaul of the application's post-login user interface for their courier company, shipreward. This session focused on fixing critical UI bugs, verifying previously created pages, and addressing new UI polish requests.

The latest user request (from message #220) is to:
1.  Remove the More Filters button from the , , and  pages.
2.  On the  page, add a cancel pickup icon after the view button in the actions column (based on a provided screenshot).
3.  On the  and  pages, make the Export button style match the one on the  page.
4.  On the  page:
    *   Change the Upgrade to Business button style.
    *   Add a Pickup Address button.
    *   Change the Submit button color for the password change form to match the My Profile button color.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application UI is significantly more polished. The critical  page has a functional three-dot action menu that is correctly positioned, and the table layout no longer has extra white space. The previously created  page and the  page have been verified and are functional. All data remains hardcoded on the frontend. The agent has read the files (, , , ) required for the next set of UI changes but has not yet modified them.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was preparing to implement a batch of UI changes requested by the user across the , , , and  pages. The agent had successfully viewed the contents of all four relevant files.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool

     - Is recurring issue? Y
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Implement UI changes on Manifest, Pickup, Invoice, and Settings pages (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The agent has already read the contents of , , , and . The next step is to use  or  to apply the user's requested changes to each of these files.
     - What will be achieved with this? This will complete the user's latest set of UI refinement requests, improving consistency and functionality across several pages.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend (using screenshot tool for each page)
     - Blocked on something: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
-   **P1**: Apply the established UI theme to the  page, which remains untouched.
-   **P2**: Complete the implementation for all 9 tabs on the  page. Several tabs still use default layouts.

Future Tasks:
-   **P1**: Implement the Admin Portal.
-   **P2**: Implement the Flutter mobile app for pickup personnel.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Three-Dot Action Menu Fix (Major Effort)**:
  - Successfully implemented the dropdown menu on the  page to open directly below the clicked icon, resolving a major recurring issue. This was achieved by:
    1.  Adding a  to the icon's parent .
    2.  Using the  prop to measure the icon's position on screen.
    3.  Storing the  and  coordinates in a state variable.
    4.  Passing these coordinates to the  and applying them as  and  styles to an absolutely positioned .
  - Fixed the positioning logic to be left-aligned as per user feedback.
- ** Table Layout Fix**:
  - Removed extra blank space on the right side of the table by changing the  style from  to a fixed  in .
- **Page Verification**:
  - ****: Confirmed the Add Order page exists and loads correctly, resolving a critical P1 issue from the previous session.
  - ****: Confirmed the newly created View Manifest page loads correctly and matches the user's requirements.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Issue 1**: Mobile rendering bug on  (vertical text). This is a recurring, ignored issue from previous sessions.
     - Debug checklist: Inspect  and fix the responsive styles.
     - Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this? Essential for a professional mobile user experience.
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix: Frontend
     - Is recurring issue? Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: The three-dot action menu functionality and positioning.
  - **Recurrence count**: This was attempted dozens of times in this session. The agent struggled significantly with debugging click events in React Native Web via the screenshot tool.
  - **Status**: RESOLVED. The final, successful approach involved capturing the element's layout coordinates () rather than relying on simulated click coordinates, which proved unreliable.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Dynamic Component Positioning**: The successful fix for the dropdown menu involved using  to get the trigger element's coordinates (, ) and using them to absolutely position the dropdown modal. This is a robust pattern for this kind of UI.
- **Expo Tunnel Debugging**: The agent encountered significant Failed to load preview errors. The resolution involved restarting the expo server (expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started) and using the direct preview URL from the  file (e.g., ) instead of the  URL, which was more reliable.
- **React Native Web Event Handling**: The agent's primary struggle was with the 's  action not registering on  components. The coordinates were often incorrect, and the event simulation was not robust. The final solution bypassed this by relying on layout measurement.

**key DB schema**
  - No changes were made to the DB schema.

**changes in tech stack**
  - No changes were made to the tech stack.

**All files of reference**
-   : Heavily modified to implement the action dropdown's dynamic positioning and to fix the table column spacing.
-   : Read in preparation for UI changes.
-   : Read in preparation for UI changes.
-   : Read in preparation for UI changes.
-   : Read in preparation for UI changes.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   ****: This file remains a >2000 line God Component. While the agent successfully modified it, its complexity is a major risk for future development. It should be broken down into smaller, reusable components (e.g., a generic , a generic , and tab-specific content components).

**key api endpoints**
- No new API endpoints were created.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **HIGHEST PRIORITY**: Start by implementing the user's latest requests from message #220. You have the contents of , , , and . Proceed with editing these files.
-   **ADDRESS THE PENDING BUG**: The mobile UI bug on  has been ignored for two sessions. It should be fixed to improve the app's first impression.
-   **EXPO PREVIEW RELIABILITY**: If you encounter Failed to load preview, first restart the expo server (expo: stopped
expo: started). If that fails, use the direct preview URL found in the  file (e.g., ) as it is more reliable than the default one.
-   **DROPDOWN IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**: The correct pattern for the action dropdown is now established in . Refer to the  function and the  implementation if you need to create similar dropdowns elsewhere. It uses  to measure position.

**documents created in this job**
  - None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **Request:** Remove blank space after the three-dot dropdown on the orders page. **Status:** COMPLETED.
2.  **Request:** The three-dot menu opens in the center; make it open on the left side. **Status:** COMPLETED.
3.  **Request:** Restart expo. **Status:** COMPLETED.
4.  **Request:** (PENDING) A new list of UI changes for the , , , and  pages. **Status:** IN PROGRESS (this is the current main task).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**:
    -   The  page has a visual bug on mobile (vertical text).
-   **Mocked**: All data in the application is hardcoded in the frontend components.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO (The agent should have used it during the dropdown debugging but eventually succeeded without it).
  - Test files created: None.
  - Known regressions: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Email**: 
-   **Password**:
