**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file is now extremely large and complex, handling rendering logic for All Orders and Drafts, pagination, state for multiple modals/dropdowns, and a huge style object. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components (e.g., , , , ).
- Many other page components (, ) are also very large and could benefit from extracting smaller UI elements into reusable components.

**key api endpoints**
- No new backend API endpoints were created in this session.
-

- 

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Development Pattern**: The user provides screenshots for each new feature. The agent builds the UI to match, verifies with , and presents the result.
- **Mock Data**: All data displayed in the app is currently static and mocked within the respective frontend component files. No new backend APIs have been built for these features.
- **Navigation**: All new pages for logged-in users must be placed in the  directory. Use the  hook from  for navigation. The user has defined specific navigation flows, such as Add Order -> Order Summary -> Drafts tab.

**documents created in this job**
- None.
