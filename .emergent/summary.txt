**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Update table row layout to match user's screenshot. (P0)
  - Issue 2: The action dropdown menu (three dots icon) on the Drafts page is not confirmed to be working. (P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Description: In message #233, the user provided an image () showing a new layout for table rows:
        - The time should be displayed directly below the date within the same cell.
        - The package type (e.g., CSB-IV) should be displayed below the weight and price within the same cell.
     - Attempted fixes: The agent acknowledged this request in message #291 but did not implement it, moving on to other tasks instead.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. Modify the  function in .
        2. Update the JSX and styles for the  and  to wrap the  components in a  with .
        3. Apply similar changes to tables on other pages (Manifest, Pickup, etc.) to ensure a consistent UI.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will match the UI to the user's specific design request, improving information density and readability in tables.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None
  - Issue 2: 
     - Description: In the initial summary, it was noted that the three-dots action dropdown on the Drafts page was not clickable. The agent has since redesigned the Actions column for the All Orders tab but has not confirmed if the fix applies to the Drafts tab or if the issue persists there.
     - Attempted fixes: None directly on the Drafts tab. A new Actions column was implemented for the main orders view.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. Navigate to the Orders page and switch to the Drafts tab.
        2. Use the  to attempt to click the three-dots icon in a row.
        3. If it fails, inspect the  function in  and ensure the  handler is correctly implemented.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This ensures users can access actions for draft orders.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI.
- **Database**: MongoDB.

**All files of reference**
*Files created or significantly modified in this session:*
-   : Completely rewritten to be a marketing landing page with a 3-in-1 auth card (Login, Register, Forgot Password).
-   : Major refactoring for mobile bottom navigation, new header layout, and responsive logic.
-   : New file created to render the company logo as an SVG.
-   : Heavily modified to add a Received tab, new action buttons, horizontal scrolling for the table on mobile, and an updated Actions column.
-   : Refactored to use responsive tabs for mobile view.
-   , , , : All updated to implement conditional horizontal scrolling on their data tables.
-   , : These files are now obsolete as their functionality has been merged into . They should be considered for deletion.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is now a massive, single-file component containing the logic and JSX for the entire landing page and three separate forms (Login, Register, Forgot Password). It should be broken down into smaller components (e.g., , , , with sub-components like , ).
-   The  file remains extremely large and complex. It should be broken down into smaller components.

**key api endpoints**
-   No new backend API endpoints were created.
-   
-   
-   

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Responsiveness Strategy**: The agent is now consistently using the  hook to differentiate between mobile and desktop layouts (e.g., ). This pattern should be continued for future responsive work.
-   **Auth Flow**: The entire authentication flow (Login, Register, Forgot Password) is now handled within . The separate  and  routes are defunct. Do not edit the old files; all changes should be made in .
-   **Testing Login**: Continue to bypass the login UI by setting  to quickly access and test authenticated routes. Use the key  and a mock JWT value.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.

2.  **Request**: Fix blank space on the desktop Wallet page by removing horizontal scroll on desktop. Add horizontal scroll to the pickup address table in Settings. **Status**: COMPLETED.
3.  **Request**: User pointed out the desktop table scroll was creating blank space and should only be active on mobile. **Status**: COMPLETED.
4.  **Request**: Build a Received tab on the Orders page, add an Export dropdown, remove the Bulk Order button, and ensure the URL doesn't change when switching tabs. **Status**: COMPLETED.
5.  **Request**: The table layout needs to be updated: time should appear below the date, and package type (e.g., CSB-IV) should appear below weight/price. **Status**: PENDING.
6.  **Request**: Create a new, modern, and creative landing page for the login screen to market the company's services and rewards. **Status**: COMPLETED.

9.  **Request**: User asks agent to continue. **Status**: ACKNOWLEDGED.
10. **Request**: User provided screenshots for Received tab and Export popup. **Status**: COMPLETED.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Functional**: The application is highly functional with a significantly improved UI/UX on both desktop and mobile. All recent user requests, except for one, have been implemented.
-   **Broken**: The table row layout does not match the user's latest design spec (from message #233).
-   **Mocked**: All application data is still hardcoded in the frontend components.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: None.
  - Known regressions: None. The agent successfully implemented conditional logic to fix a regression where desktop tables had unnecessary horizontal scrollbars.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   The agent uses  within the browser's developer console (or via 's  feature) to simulate a logged-in state and bypass the login form for testing internal pages.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not implement the table row layout changes (stacking time under date, and package details under weight/price) requested by the user in message #233, despite acknowledging it. This is the highest priority for the next agent.
